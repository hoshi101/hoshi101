### Hi, I'm Hoshi!

👨‍💻 I need to be a Programmer, whatever software, hardware, ai, machine learning, etc.

🧑‍🎓 I'm Junior student (3 Year) at Silpakorn University [Electronics and Computer Systems Engineering Program]

🪅 My other skills: Fundamentals of computer hardware, video editing, design and typing at a speed around 76-92 wpm (kind of funny to mention this 😂).

💭 Currently learning about AI, Machine learning, Cybersecurity(i don't know how to start TT) and every programming language that I am able to learn ✌️

📖 Currently studying and exploring additional programs such as Go, Vue, and various frameworks 🎯 (update 01/12/2024)
